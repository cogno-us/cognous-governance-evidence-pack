# Validation

The `validate_evidence_pack` function checks an `EvidencePack` instance and returns a `ValidationReport`.

```python
from agent_governance_evidence_pack import load_evidence_pack, validate_evidence_pack

pack = load_evidence_pack("examples/customer_service_agent_evidence_pack.json")
report = validate_evidence_pack(pack)
print(report.valid)   # True or False
print(report.issues)  # list of ValidationIssue
```

---

## ValidationReport

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `valid` | bool | True if no error-severity issues exist. Warnings do not affect validity. |
| `pack_id` | str \| None | The pack_id of the pack validated. |
| `issues` | list | List of `ValidationIssue` records. |

## ValidationIssue

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `severity` | enum | `"error"` or `"warning"`. |
| `code` | str | Stable code string (e.g., `E001`, `W003`). |
| `message` | str | Business-readable description. |
| `path` | str \| None | Field path where the issue was found. |

## What a valid result means

A valid result establishes the integrity and internal consistency of the record. It does not establish that the recorded decision was the correct one, and no check described here evaluates whether an action was permitted.

---

## Error Rules

Errors cause `valid=False`.

| Code | Rule |
|---|---|
| E001 | `pack_id` must be non-empty. |
| E002 | `title` must be non-empty. |
| E003 | `generated_at` must be non-empty. |
| E004 | `agent_overview.agent_name` must be non-empty. |
| E005 | `agent_overview.business_purpose` must be non-empty. |
| E006 | `deployment_context.environment` must be present. |
| E007 | `tool_inventory` tool_name values must be unique. |
| E008 | `action_inventory` action_name values must be unique. |
| E009 | Every `ActionInventoryItem.tool_name` must reference an existing `ToolInventoryItem`. |
| E010 | Blocked action `count` must not be negative. |
| E011 | Reliance `count` must not be negative. |
| E012 | `risk_register` risk_id values must be unique. |
| E013 | `replay_bundles` bundle_id values must be unique. |
| E014 | `redaction_exports` export_id values must be unique. |
| E015 | `review_status` "approved" or "approved_with_conditions" requires at least one `ReviewRecord` whose decision equals the status and that has a non-empty `reviewer` and `reviewed_at`. |
| E016 | `ReviewRecord` decision "approved" or "approved_with_conditions" requires `reviewed_at`. |
| E017 | A critical open risk prevents approval: if `review_status` is "approved" and a risk is critical and open, this is an error. |
| E018 | An action with `authority_required=True` requires `authority_model` to be present. |
| E019 | An action with `review_required=True` requires at least one policy control that mentions review or approval. |
| E020 | `review_status` "approved" with an empty `replay_bundles` list is an error. |
| E_BUDGET | Trace metadata exceeds the admission budget. |
| E_TRACE_SEMANTICS | An imported pack (`pack_id` starting `agep-` or `pack_version` 0.2.0) carries no `metadata.traceable_import`, or the retained sources fail the pinned Replay semantic validation or comparison. This and `E_BUDGET` are the checks that bind an imported pack to its sources; they are reported only for imports. |

## Warning Rules

Warnings do not affect validity. They flag gaps that may need attention.

| Code | Rule |
|---|---|
| W001 | `agent_overview.owner` is missing. |
| W002 | `agent_overview.business_unit` is missing. |
| W003 | `deployment_context.systems_touched` is empty. |
| W004 | `deployment_context.data_domains` is empty. |
| W005 | `tool_inventory` is empty. |
| W006 | `action_inventory` is empty. |
| W007 | `policy_controls` is empty. |
| W008 | `blocked_actions` is empty. |
| W009 | `reliance_summary` is empty. |
| W010 | `replay_bundles` is empty. |
| W011 | `validation_summary` is missing. |
| W012 | `redaction_exports` is empty. |
| W013 | `risk_register` is empty. |
| W014 | `review_records` is empty. |
| W015 | Production deployment with `review_status` "draft" or "in_review". |
| W016 | Production deployment with no redaction exports. |
| W017 | Production deployment with no signed replay bundles. |
| W018 | Action of type `external_send`, `write`, `delete`, `export`, `purchase`, or `approve` without `review_required=True`. |
| W019 | Action of type `external_send`, `write`, `delete`, `export`, `purchase`, or `approve` without `authority_required=True`. |
| W020 | Tool with `external_system` set but `data_classification` missing. |
