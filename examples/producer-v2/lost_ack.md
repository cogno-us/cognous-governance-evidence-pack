## 7. Policy Controls

| Control Name | Description | Status | Evidence Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Manifest declaration | Actions and requirements imported from Manifest v1.1. Declaration alone does not establish implementation. | planned | metadata.traceable_import.input_artifacts&#91;manifest&#93; |

## 15. Known Limitations

This evidence pack summarizes available runtime and governance records. It does not prove that model outputs are correct, policy controls are sufficient, compliance obligations are satisfied, deployment is approved, controls are operationally effective, or independent audit has occurred. Schema validity and successful reconstruction are review aids only.

## 16. Traceability and Import Provenance

This section is generated from `metadata.traceable_import`. It is review support only. It does not certify deployment approval, compliance, operational effectiveness, or independent audit.

### Input artifacts

| Role | Artifact ID | Version | Hash | Trusted Revision | Verification Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| manifest | refund-integration-pilot-v1 | 1.1 | sha256:4d1ad6c96bc242c63998231b4df3ad7c86dc2e5e59cdae63afe7bff86e60f6ac | 46c950bed37fe3812000895430bc0312d29e37ce | digest_and_cross_artifact_binding_checked_when_runtime_proposal_present |

### Transformation

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Transformation Version | agep-manifest-reconstruction-import/0.3.0 |
| Canonicalization Profile | json-sort-keys-compact-utf8-no-nan |

### Derived counts

| Count | Value |
|---|---|
| proposal_count | 1 |
| decision_count | 1 |
| distinct_effect_count | 1 |
| control_plane_attempt_count | 1 |
| executor_attempt_count | 1 |
| attempt_transition_record_count | 4 |
| authorization_granted_count | 1 |
| authorization_held_count | 0 |
| authorization_denied_count | 0 |
| destination_observation.absent | 1 |
| destination_observation.applied | 1 |
| acknowledgement.control_plane_unknown | 1 |
| acknowledgement.execution_result_unknown | 1 |

Counting rules:
- Repeated lifecycle records do not inflate attempt counts.
- Duplicate submissions do not inflate distinct effect counts when effect_id is unchanged.
- Control Plane and executor attempt IDs are separate namespaces unless explicit correlation exists.
- Destination effects, effect observations and reconciliations are counted separately.
- Missing observations are unavailable, not success or failure.
- Latest supported state uses Replay producer sequence and exact effect lineage; earlier rejection remains visible. Independent clocks do not establish ordering.

### Lifecycle and effect status

| Dimension | Value |
|---|---|
| authorization | authorized |
| current_permission | not_evaluated_from_historical_records |
| execution_attempted | yes |
| acknowledgement | unknown |
| destination_observed | applied |
| destination_observation_scope | latest supplied Control Plane reconciliation per exact effect; not a fresh query |
| reconstruction_status | reconstruction_complete |
| retry_permission | not_established |
| independent_verification | unavailable |

- Historical authorization is retained evidence and does not establish current permission.
- Control Plane transition status is preserved separately from acknowledgement receipt.
- Executor acknowledgement is distinct from independently verified delivery.
- A lost or unknown acknowledgement followed by an applied observation retains both facts.
- Observed local destination state does not establish independently verified institutional outcome.
- Reconstruction completeness does not mean effect completion.
- HMAC/shared-secret integrity is not public issuer identity or independent review.
- A software-generated pack cannot create human approval.

### Control evidence levels

| Level | Status | Evidence | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| semantic_validation_performed_during_import | validated_complete | metadata.traceable_import.replay_semantic_validation | the importer executed the accepted Replay semantic validator; this is not a test-run or runtime-control-effectiveness claim |
| source_asserted_runtime_evidence | unavailable | — | no source runtime or fixture provenance was supplied |
| attributable_test_run_evidence | unavailable | — | no complete attributable test-run provenance was supplied |
| declared | present | manifest | control or requirement is declared only |
| implemented | not_established_by_import | — | implementation requires producer-specific evidence; manifest declarations and import success do not suffice |
| tested | unavailable | — | semantic import validation and source runtime records do not by themselves establish that a test occurred |
| tested_in_this_repository | not_evaluated_during_import | — | this import does not execute or imply execution of the Evidence Pack repository test suite |
| operationally_observed | unavailable | — | no production operational observation supplied |
| independently_audited | unavailable | — | no independent audit or certification supplied |

### Import findings and unresolved limitations

| Code | Severity | Path/Source | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| REPLAY_M002 | warning | attempt_correlation | Control Plane and executor attempt namespaces are preserved separately; no equivalence is inferred. |
| REPLAY_M003 | info | moltbot.execution_envelope.operation.institution_id | Institution/domain provenance is the trusted Moltbot integration context, not Control Plane AuthorizationBinding. |
| REPLAY_M004 | info | moltbot.execution_envelope.operation.authority_context_id | At the pinned adapter this field carries the proposal profile reference; it is distinct from the Control Plane binding context-instance ID. |
| REPLAY_SEMANTIC_LIMITATION | info | semantics.notes | Replay reconstructs recorded events only; import never renews permission or creates an effect. |
| R_REDACTION_UNVERIFIED | warning | — | Source declarations do not verify removal of sensitive content; export safety is unverified. |

### Unresolved issues

| Code | Severity | Message |
|---|---|---|
| U_INDEPENDENT_VERIFICATION_UNAVAILABLE | warning | Destination observation is producer-retained unless independent verifier evidence is supplied. |
| U_OPERATIONAL_EFFECTIVENESS_NOT_MEASURED | warning | Synthetic import success cannot support operational effectiveness or deployment approval. |
| U_HISTORICAL_AUTHORIZATION_NOT_CURRENT_PERMISSION | info | Retained authorization is historical evidence only; current permission must be re-evaluated by the runtime authority/control boundary. |
| U_EXCHANGE_METADATA_SUPPLEMENTARY | info | Accepted GAX/IMX exchange metadata remains supplementary unless represented by a supported Replay mapping; the Evidence Pack does not invent exchange fields. |

### Producer profiles

| Profile | Repository | Revision | Format Version | Revision Check | Independent Provenance Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| control-plane-bounded-run@2ea9528e | cogno-us/cognous-agent-control-plane | 2ea9528eeb87e14ff10f05de06473122b9df540f | — | declared_revision_matches_accepted_pin | not_performed |

### Executor producer contract

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| interface_profile_id | urn:cognous:profiles:moltbot-safe-executor-producer |
| interface_profile_version | 2.0.0 |
| repository_revision | 177354e959cc78c59c1a776f018cfbfbf28c927b |
| legacy | False |
| source_asserted_repository_revision | 177354e959cc78c59c1a776f018cfbfbf28c927b |
| source_asserted_profile_id | urn:cognous:profiles:moltbot-safe-executor-producer |
| source_asserted_profile_version | 2.0.0 |
| independently_established_count | 0 |

Executor producer metadata and repository revision are source assertions unless separately established. A locally computed commitment or successful semantic import does not authenticate the producer or independently verify the outcome.

### Conversion losses and source findings

| Code | Category | Severity | Path | Value State | Message |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M002 | unsupported_semantic | warning | attempt_correlation | unknown | Control Plane and executor attempt namespaces are preserved separately; no equivalence is inferred. |
| M003 | conversion_warning | info | moltbot.execution_envelope.operation.institution_id | — | Institution/domain provenance is the trusted Moltbot integration context, not Control Plane AuthorizationBinding. |
| M004 | conversion_warning | info | moltbot.execution_envelope.operation.authority_context_id | — | At the pinned adapter this field carries the proposal profile reference; it is distinct from the Control Plane binding context-instance ID. |
